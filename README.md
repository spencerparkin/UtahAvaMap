# UtahAvaMap

Overlay current avalanche hazard conditions on a map as a function of the avalanche rose.

Following is a screen-shot of the web-app.  I'll post a better one once the UAC forecasts start.
For now, the rose is grey, because there is no forecast.  The green shading indicates a low danger
rating for those areas of the map.  This, of course, must be taken with a very large grain of salt.

You can try the app at the following link, but know that the server response time is going to
be quite slow, because I'm not paying Render any money.  Also, I won't be able to test that the
app is fully functional again until the UAC starts forecasting again.  It's been years since I
developed the app, and just recently got it out of moth balls.
