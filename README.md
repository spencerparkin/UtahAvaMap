# UtahAvaMap

Overlay current avalanche hazard conditions on a map as a function of the avalanche rose.

Following is a screen-shot of the web-app.  I'll post a better one once the UAC forecasts start.
For now, the rose is grey, because there is no forecast.  The green shading indicates a lower danger
rating for those areas of the map.  This, of course, must be taken with a very large grain of salt.

The following link is broken.  I stopped using Heroku, because it stopped being free for hobbyists.
