# UtahAvaMap

Overlay current avalanche hazard conditions on a map as a function of the avalanche rose.

The current snap-shot is as follows, which isn't very helpful, because (1) the project is broken
until I can learn how to use the async/await keywords (wasn't originally required to use the
Cesium API) and (2) there is a valid UAC forecast to use.

The following link is broken.  I stopped using Heroku, because it stopped being free for hobbyists.
