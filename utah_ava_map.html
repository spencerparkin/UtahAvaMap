            The forecast data is an approximation based on human field observations that don't necessarily generalize
            everywhere (think spacial variability); and the map software,
            although crafted with the best of intentions, may have defects.  The information provided here,
            even if it was somehow a perfect reflection of reality, is not, and cannot be a substitute for your
